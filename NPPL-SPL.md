# Relationship Between NPPL (Microlight) and EASA SPL

The **National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) with a Microlight rating** and the **EASA Sailplane Pilot Licence (SPL)** are distinct certifications tailored for different types of aircraft and flying privileges.

## NPPL (Microlight)

- **Scope:** Permits pilots to operate microlight aircraft, typically defined as lightweight, two-seat, single-engine aircraft with a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 450 kg.

- **Training Requirements:**
  - Approximately 25 hours of flight training, including at least 10 hours of solo flight time.
  - Ground examinations in subjects such as Air Law, Navigation, and Meteorology.

- **Medical Requirements:** A valid EASA medical certificate (Class 1, 2, or LAPL) is required before solo flights.

## EASA Sailplane Pilot Licence (SPL)

- **Scope:** Allows pilots to act as Pilot-in-Command (PIC) on sailplanes and powered sailplanes.

- **Training Requirements:**
  - A minimum of 15 hours of flight instruction in sailplanes or powered sailplanes, including at least:
    - 10 hours of dual flight instruction.
    - 2 hours of solo flight time.
    - 45 launches and landings.
  - Theoretical knowledge examinations in relevant subjects.

- **Medical Requirements:** A valid EASA medical certificate appropriate for sailplane operations.

## Relationship Between NPPL (Microlight) and EASA SPL

While both licenses pertain to light aviation, they are designed for different aircraft categories:

- **NPPL (Microlight):** Focused on microlight aircraft operations.

- **EASA SPL:** Specific to sailplane (glider) operations.

Holding an NPPL (Microlight) does not directly contribute to obtaining an EASA SPL, as the training and experience requirements differ.

## Pathway to EASA SPL

If you hold an NPPL (Microlight) and wish to obtain an EASA SPL, you would need to:

1. **Enroll in an Approved Training Organization (ATO):** Select a flight school authorized to provide sailplane training under EASA regulations.

2. **Complete Required Training:**
   - Fulfill the minimum flight instruction hours specific to sailplanes.
   - Pass the necessary theoretical knowledge examinations.

3. **Obtain Medical Certification:** Secure the appropriate EASA medical certificate for sailplane operations.

4. **Pass Skill Test:** Successfully complete a skill test with an authorized examiner to demonstrate proficiency in sailplane operations.

For detailed information on SPL requirements, refer to the Civil Aviation Authority's guidelines. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Conclusion

The NPPL (Microlight) and EASA SPL serve different aviation sectors. Transitioning from one to the other requires meeting the specific training, medical, and examination requirements set forth by EASA for sailplane pilots.
