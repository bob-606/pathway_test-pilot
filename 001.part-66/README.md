# WHAT IF I GET ALL THE PART 66 EXAMS DONE IN ESTONIA??

To pursue both EASA Part 66 Category B (Estonia) and Category C (Finland) licenses simultaneously after gaining experience in Portugal:

### **1. Experience in Portugal (3 Years)**
- **Ensure Eligibility**:  
  - Log **practical experience** under EASA Part 145 or approved maintenance organizations.  
  - Document tasks in line with EASA Part 66 requirements for **Category B** (e.g., aircraft systems, line maintenance) and **Category C** (base maintenance, release certification).  
  - Obtain signatures from EASA-certified supervisors to validate experience.

---

### **2. Theoretical Knowledge Preparation**
- **For Estonia (Category B)**:  
  - Complete **EASA Part 66 modules** relevant to your subcategory (B1/B2).  
  - Pass exams through an EASA Part 147 school or directly via Transpordiamet.  

- **For Finland (Category C – Academic Route)**:  
  - Hold an **engineering degree** (e.g., aerospace, mechanical) recognized by EASA.  
  - Verify if your degree covers required **Part 66 modules** for Category C. Supplement with additional exams if needed.

---

### **3. Simultaneous Application Process**
#### **Estonia (Category B License)**
- **Submit to Transpordiamet**:  
  - Proof of Portuguese experience (logbook, employer letters).  
  - Passed Part 66 exam certificates.  
  - Application fee and language proficiency.  

#### **Finland (Category C License)**
- **Submit to Traficom (Finnish Transport Agency)**:  
  - Academic transcripts and degree certificates.  
  - Experience documentation (highlighting base maintenance tasks).  
  - Proof of completed Part 66 modules or exemptions via academic route.  

---

### **4. Key Considerations**
- **Language**: Confirm exam language.  
- **Documentation**: Translate Portuguese experience logs into English/Finnish/Estonian if required.  
- **Timeline**: Expect delays; start applications early.  
- **Costs**: Budget for exams (~€100–€300/module), translation, and administrative fees.  

---

### **5. Post-Licensing**
- **Validity**: EASA licenses are valid EU-wide.  
- **Career Flexibility**:  
  - **Category B**: Certify line maintenance (B1/B2).  
  - **Category C**: Certify full aircraft release after base maintenance.  

---

### **Potential Challenges**
- **Experience Recognition**: Ensure Portugal-based experience aligns with both countries’ requirements.  
- **Academic Route (Finland)**: Confirm if your degree qualifies for Category C exemptions.  
- **Dual Applications**: Manage administrative complexity by coordinating with both authorities.  

### **Next Steps**
- Contact **Transpordiamet** (Estonia) and **Traficom** (Finland) for detailed checklists.  
- Enroll in Part 66 modules/exams early to align with application timelines.  

By addressing these steps, you can efficiently pursue both licenses, leveraging your experience and academic background for a versatile career in aircraft maintenance.
