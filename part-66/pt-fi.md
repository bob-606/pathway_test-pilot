## **4. Risks & Mitigation**  
| Risk                                  | Mitigation Strategy                 |

| **Delayed Finnish employment**        | Apply to Finnish MROs while in Portugal (e.g., Nordic Aviation Group). |  
| **Degree not recognized**             | Validate through a **Finnish Part-147 school** (e.g., Insinöörioppilaitos)[1]. |
