Dear Sir 

The Finnish Transport and Communications Agency (Traficom) requires obtaining a Finnish personal identity code from the Finnish Digital and Population Data Services Agency. The personal identity code is used to identify persons in the registers and information systems of different authorities as well as in data communication between them.

Traficom does not have the capacity to have licenced personnel without connection to Finland either by work or residence. The authority shall have the capacity to verify documentations and perform audit of personnel and organisations. (66.B.10(b))

To apply for a personal licence You should therefore have an personal identity code and either work for a company with connection to Finland or have residence in Finland. Should You at a later stage fulfil these criteria, You are welcome to contact us again.

With Best Regards \
Mr. J
