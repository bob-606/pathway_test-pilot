If a candidate has only the examination certificates from a Part-147 training organization but did not complete the full training program, the requirements for obtaining a Part-66 licence in Finland can be more stringent. Hereâ€™s how this situation typically breaks down:

### Requirements for Candidates with Only Examination Certificates

1. **Age Requirement**:
   - The candidate must be at least **18 years old**.

2. **Training and Examinations**:
   - While having examination certificates from a Part-147 organization demonstrates knowledge, candidates typically must also have completed the corresponding **basic training course** to qualify for a Part-66 licence.
   - If the candidate has only the exam certificates and did not undergo the full training, they may need to complete an approved basic training course to fulfill the training requirement.

3. **Experience Requirements**:
   - Regardless of whether the candidate has completed training, they still need to meet the experience requirements:
     - For **Category A or B** licences: 
       - At least **12 months of relevant civil aircraft maintenance experience**.
       - This experience must be within the **10 years preceding the application**, including at least **6 months of recent maintenance experience** during the year before applying.
     - For a **Category C licence**: 
       - The candidate must have at least **three years of civil aircraft maintenance experience**.

4. **Application Process**:
   - The candidate should gather all necessary documentation, including:
     - Examination certificates from the Part-147 organization.
     - Proof of practical maintenance experience (logbook).
     - Any additional documentation as required by Traficom.
   - Submit an application to Traficom, ensuring that all requirements are met.

5. **Medical Requirements**:
   - There are no specific medical requirements mandated by EU legislation for Part-66 licence applicants.

### Conclusion
In summary, if the candidate only holds examination certificates without completing an approved basic training course, they will likely need to complete that training before they can apply for a Part-66 licence in Finland. Additionally, they must meet the relevant experience requirements based on the category of licence they are pursuing.

For personalized guidance and to clarify any specific circumstances, it is advisable for the candidate to consult directly with Traficom or refer to EASA regulations regarding aircraft maintenance licensing.
