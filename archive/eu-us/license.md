# Converting EASA Pilot Licenses to FAA Certificates

Converting your European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) pilot license to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificate is feasible, with specific procedures depending on the license type.

## Private Pilot License (PPL)

- **Conversion Process:** Under 14 CFR 61.75, an EASA PPL can be converted to an FAA Private Pilot Certificate without additional testing.

- **Instrument Rating (IR):** If your EASA PPL includes an Instrument Rating, you may need to complete additional training, such as 10 hours of theoretical instruction and 10 hours of flight training, to meet FAA standards. 

## Commercial Pilot License (CPL) and Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL)

- **Conversion Process:** The FAA does not offer direct conversions for EASA CPL or ATPL. You must meet specific FAA requirements, including passing written and practical exams, to obtain the equivalent FAA certificate. 

## Flight Instructor Certificates

- **Conversion Process:** Converting an EASA Flight Instructor Certificate to an FAA Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) certificate requires:

  - Passing the FAA Fundamentals of Instructing (FOI) and Flight Instructor Airplane (FIA) knowledge tests.

  - Completing a practical test.

  - Holding an FAA Commercial Pilot Certificate or higher. 

## General Conversion Steps

1. **Verification:** Submit FAA Form 8060-71 to verify your EASA license's authenticity. 

2. **FAA Requirements:** Ensure compliance with FAA regulations, including obtaining a valid FAA medical certificate and demonstrating English language proficiency.

3. **Testing:** Prepare for and pass the required FAA knowledge and practical exams for your desired certificate or rating.

4. **Application:** Submit the necessary application forms, along with proof of eligibility and test results, to the FAA.

## Considerations

- **Limitations:** An FAA certificate issued based on a foreign license may have certain limitations, such as dependency on the validity of your EASA license.

- **Currency:** Maintaining the validity of your EASA license is crucial, as it can affect your FAA certificate's status.

- **Regulatory Differences:** Be aware of procedural differences between EASA and FAA regulations, which may require additional training.

For detailed guidance, refer to FAA Advisory Circular AC 61-143, which outlines the conversion process between FAA and EASA licenses. 

Consulting with a flight training provider experienced in license conversions is advisable to navigate the process effectively.
