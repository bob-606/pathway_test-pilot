To obtain an EASA Private Pilot Licence (PPL) starting from a UK PPL, particularly after the anticipated regulatory changes in 2025, the process involves several steps. Below is a structured overview of how this conversion would work:

## Steps to Convert UK PPL to EASA PPL

| **Step**                       | **Description**                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Verify Eligibility**      | Ensure you hold a valid UK PPL and have at least 100 hours of total flight time.                  |
| **2. Obtain a Medical Certificate** | Acquire an EASA Class 2 Medical Certificate from an approved Aero-Medical Examiner (AME).          |
| **3. Complete Required Exams** | Pass the required theoretical knowledge exams: <br> - Air Law <br> - Human Performance & Limitations |
| **4. Language Proficiency Test** | Complete an English Language Proficiency (ELP) test, if necessary, to meet EASA requirements.     |
| **5. Skill Test**              | Successfully pass a PPL skill test with an EASA-approved flight examiner in an EASA-registered aircraft. |
| **6. Submit Application**      | Apply for your EASA PPL through the relevant EASA member state's civil aviation authority.        |

## Important Considerations

- **Retaining UK PPL**: You can retain your UK PPL while obtaining an EASA PPL, as the conversion does not nullify your existing licence. This allows you to operate both UK-registered and EASA-registered aircraft.
  
- **Flight Experience**: If you have more than 100 hours of flying experience, you may qualify for some exemptions during the conversion process, making it easier to transition.

- **Documentation**: Ensure all necessary documentation, including your medical certificate and proof of flight hours, is prepared for the application process.

## Summary

The conversion from a UK PPL to an EASA PPL is designed to be straightforward for pilots who meet the eligibility criteria and complete the required training and testing. By following these steps, you can successfully navigate the transition and maintain the ability to fly under both licensing systems.
