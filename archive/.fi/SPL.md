# How to Get a Sailplane License (SPL) in Finland

To obtain a sailplane license (SPL) in Finland, you must navigate through a series of requirements and training components. Below is a detailed breakdown of the process:

## Eligibility Requirements

1. **Age**: You must be at least **16 years old** to start your training and apply for the SPL.
2. **Medical Certificate**: A valid medical certificate from an Aero Medical Examiner (AME) is required before you can fly solo. This certificate ensures you meet the health standards necessary for flying, similar to those required for a driver's license. Basic health is generally sufficient, and conditions like wearing glasses do not disqualify you.

## Training Components

### Theoretical Knowledge

- **Coursework**: You'll need to complete a theoretical knowledge course covering topics such as:
  - Aerodynamics
  - Flight performance
  - Meteorology
  - Navigation
  - Air law and regulations
- **Examinations**: After completing the coursework, you must pass theoretical examinations administered by the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency (Traficom). These exams can be taken before completing all practical flight training.

### Practical Flight Training

- **Flight Instruction**: Practical training consists of dual flights with an instructor and solo flights. The minimum flight training requirements include:
  - **Total Flight Hours**: At least **15 hours** of flight time, including specific solo flight time.
  - **Solo Flights**: You must complete a minimum number of solo flights as part of your training.
- **Skill Test**: After finishing your flight instruction and passing theoretical exams, you will undergo a skill test with an approved flight examiner. This test assesses your flying skills and knowledge.

## Application Process

1. **Complete Training**: Finish both the theoretical and practical components of your training.
2. **Pass Examinations**: Successfully pass both the theoretical knowledge examinations and the skill test.
3. **Apply for License**: Submit your application for the SPL to Traficom, including proof of your completed training and examinations.

## Additional Considerations

- If you hold a national glider pilot license (GPL), it must be converted into an EASA license (SPL) as per regulations effective from April 2021. After this date, national GPLs only allow flying aircraft outside EASA regulations.
- Many flight schools offer programs in English, making it accessible for non-Finnish speakers.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can successfully obtain your sailplane license in Finland and enjoy the freedom of gliding through the skies.
