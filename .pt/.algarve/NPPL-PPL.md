# NOTE THAT THE UK AUTORITY IS TRYING TO MERGE NPPL & PPL [WHY?](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-the-uk-government-trying-to-MeUySDoqSrmkf5b8mDiFOA?utm_source=copy_output)

# Pathway from NPPL (Microlight) to EASA PPL and Flight Instructor Certification

Transitioning from a UK-issued National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) with a Microlight rating to an EASA Private Pilot Licence (PPL) and subsequently to a Flight Instructor (FI) certificate involves several steps.

## 1. Converting NPPL (Microlight) to EASA PPL

**Current Status:**

- The NPPL (Microlight) is a national UK license and is not directly convertible to an EASA PPL. However, flight experience gained under the NPPL may be credited towards the requirements for an EASA license. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**Recommended Pathway:**

- **Obtain an NPPL (SSEA):** Converting your NPPL (Microlight) to an NPPL with a Simple Single Engine Aircraft (SSEA) rating can be a beneficial intermediate step. This process involves additional training and successful completion of the necessary skill tests. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **Convert to EASA LAPL (A):** Once you hold an NPPL (SSEA), you may be eligible to convert it to an EASA Light Aircraft Pilot Licence (LAPL) for aeroplanes. This conversion requires meeting specific training and experience requirements. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

- **Upgrade to EASA PPL (A):** After obtaining the LAPL (A), you can pursue additional training to meet the requirements for an EASA PPL (A). This step typically involves completing further flight hours, theoretical knowledge examinations, and a skill test. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 2. Pursuing an EASA Flight Instructor (FI) Certificate

**Prerequisites:**

- **EASA PPL (A):** Hold a valid EASA PPL (A) with the appropriate ratings.

- **Flight Experience:**
  - Accumulate at least 200 hours of total flight time, including 150 hours as Pilot-in-Command (PIC).
  - Complete 30 hours on Single Engine Piston (SEP) aeroplanes, with at least 5 hours in the preceding 6 months before the pre-entry flight test.
  - Log 10 hours of instrument flight instruction (up to 5 hours may be in a simulator).
  - Complete 20 hours of cross-country flight time as PIC, including a 540 km (300 NM) flight with full-stop landings at two different aerodromes.

- **Pre-Entry Flight Test:** Pass a specific pre-entry flight test within the 6 months preceding the start of the FI course. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**FI Course Structure:**

- **Theoretical Instruction:** Approximately 125 hours covering instructional techniques and relevant aviation subjects.

- **Flight Training:** At least 30 hours of flight instruction, including dual instruction and mutual flying with another student instructor or qualified FI. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

**Assessment:**

- Upon completion of the FI course, you must pass an assessment of competence, which includes theoretical examinations and in-flight demonstrations. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Considerations

- **Regulatory Changes:** Aviation regulations are subject to change. It's essential to consult with approved training organizations and the relevant aviation authorities to obtain current information and personalized guidance.

- **Training Providers:** Engaging with flight schools experienced in license conversions and instructor training can facilitate a smoother transition through these pathways.

By following these steps and meeting the necessary requirements, you can progress from holding an NPPL (Microlight) to obtaining an EASA PPL and ultimately achieve an EASA Flight Instructor certificate.
